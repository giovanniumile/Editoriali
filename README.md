# Editoriali
In this repository I'll upload some editorials. They don't want to be considered as extremely detalied quantitative analysis: they'll be a mix between data and some observations. The fact is that I've studied Physics but I still have several passions. In particular, in these articles I'll put the focus on political analysis and economic politics.
