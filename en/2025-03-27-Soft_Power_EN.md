_Soft Power_ is a term borrowed from military jargon. It indicates a State’s ability to exert a certain influence in some parts of the world without using weapons, troops, or other means. In other words, it refers to an *auctoritas* that allows a country to carry weight in the unfolding of history, avoiding the most commonly used means to shape it: war.

But could there also be _economic_ soft power? Looking at the latest budget law (_loi de finances_) proposed by the Bayrou government, I would be inclined to say yes. Let’s dig a bit deeper by comparing Italy and France, two major European countries with many significant similarities and a few huge differences.

1. Let’s start with the **similarities** between the two countries.

   - *Debt*. Both countries are large, highly indebted economies. The debt/GDP ratio in 2024 is 112% for France and 139% for Italy. Moreover, both countries struggle to contain their debt, which keeps growing year after year.

   - *Bureaucracy*. France and Italy are, respectively, the second- and third-most difficult EU member states in which to do business (source: Global Business Complexity Index (GBCI) 2024 by TMF Group). Greece takes the top spot.

   - *Taxes*. The tax burden in both countries is among the highest in the world. France and Italy occupy first (43.8%) and third (42.8%) place respectively in the EU for the taxes-to-GDP ratio.

   - *Slow growth*. Although _l’Hexagone_ has suffered less than the _il_Belpaese_, economic growth on the northern side of the Alps is also sluggish, and in the decade before COVID, the gap with their German neighbors only grew wider.

2. The key **differences** are more historical/cultural in nature, but here are two telling examples:

   - *Union strength*. Alongside the huge issue of *productivity*, which would require a much broader discussion than this editorial allows, the union question is central to the wage problem. Strong unions that are less subservient to politics (or to one side of it) have allowed French workers to enjoy an almost constant rise in their wages. By contrast, Italian wages have been virtually stagnant since 1990. Interestingly, Italian and French unions call the highest number of strikes in Europe, yet only in one of these countries do those strikes translate into an actual advantage for workers.

   - *National consciousness*. Disclaimer: this is a purely personal observation, based on my experience in France.
     Italians are far less accustomed to large-scale street protests. For instance, in the face of the last major reforms—such as the Fornero Law on pensions (Monti government) and the Jobs Act (Renzi government)—the mobilization and protests by unions and civil society were quite limited (memorable were the mere four hours of strike called by CGIL against the Jobs Act). By contrast, in recent years, France has witnessed huge protests, such as the *gilets jaunes*, farmers’ protests, and the massive demonstrations against pension reform in 2023. This large difference in self-awareness implies a diametrically opposite relationship between the people and the institutions (or power, more broadly). In a nation where popular self-awareness is strong, the institutions’ room for maneuver shrinks, since it is taken for granted that those in power are always subject to close popular scrutiny. In the specific case of France, what may seem counterintuitive becomes logical: the enormous, almost monarchical power concentrated in the hands of the President—enshrined in the Constitution advocated by De Gaulle—is balanced, by an unwritten but tangible law, by the counterweight of popular consciousness. 
     On the other hand, in a nation like Italy, where popular awareness is almost nonexistent, the institutions have both a wide margin of maneuver and a responsibility that they only need to answer according to their own conscience, for a simple reason: the people are not the guardians of power.

3. **Budget laws**. Returning to the concept of soft power, let’s now examine the latest budget laws, bearing in mind that after the COVID years, European states are trying to realign with the parameters set by the *fiscal compact*, among which the 3% deficit/GDP cap stands out. In Italy’s case, thanks to restrained spending, higher tax revenues, and cuts to various ministries announced by Economy Minister Giorgetti, the deficit/GDP ratio for 2024 stalled at 3.8%, and the projected figure for 2025 will drop to 3.2%, with a declared target of 2.7% in 2026 (source: ilSole24ore). On the other side of the Alps, France’s deficit/GDP ratio for 2024 came in at 6.1%, and for 2025 it is forecast to be 5.4% (source: Assemblée Nationale), well above the 3% limit. The previous government, led by Barnier, collapsed three months after its inauguration, having proposed various spending cuts aimed at keeping the deficit below 5% in 2025. Essentially, regardless of the government’s political leaning, in France it is simply impossible to contain deficit spending. With deficit levels this high, the only hope to avoid further debt/GDP growth would be an economic boom—but that’s not happening. Some studies predict a stabilization of France’s debt/GDP ratio in the coming years, but looking at the data, such a stabilization will remain a mirage: with deficits so high and growth so low, the debt/GDP ratio will continue to rise every year. France’s power becomes evident when, in the face of these repeated breaches of budget rules, it faces neither drastic measures from rating agencies nor fierce opposition from European institutions—unlike what happened with other countries (recalling only the famous tug-of-war in 2018 with the Lega-M5S government in Italy, where the 2.4% deficit magically became 2.04%, still well below the 3% threshold).

4. **Rating**. In conclusion, Italy is stably in bad shape, France is in somewhat poor shape and is doing everything possible to catch up to us quickly. There is one crucial difference: in Italy, major spending-control reforms are not undertaken because of negligent governments, while in France they simply cannot be implemented for fear of popular uprisings. Paradoxical though it may sound, Italy’s situation is more easily managed: all that’s needed are sufficiently brave governments and parliaments. Yet at the media and political levels, one of these two states continues to be labeled as the “sick man of Europe,” whereas the other is seen as a solid country going through a few minor difficulties. And here politics enters the picture, where form and substance blend into a single mysterious entity. We Italians love to portray ourselves as worse off than we actually are, whereas our cousins beyond the Alps, especially at the institutional level, do the opposite. These two relentless and opposing narratives have led to a huge gap between the two countries’ ratings: BBB for Italy and AA- for France, a 5-notch difference according to S&P. For reference, Italy’s rating is only two steps above “junk,” while France’s, which recently underwent a downgrade, is just two notches below that of the United States. This gap does not align with reality or with the markets. Italy’s situation is difficult, but far better than we like to claim. And if politics is shortsighted, the markets are much less so. For example, the latest ten-year BTP issuance, an 18-billion-euro offer, received purchase requests of 270 billion—15 times as much! This means that, for the markets, buying Italian bonds is an excellent investment because the yield is higher than it should be, and the actual risk is lower than the ratings suggest. Conversely, France’s situation is far less rosy than its institutions would like us to believe; nevertheless, downgrades to France’s rating remain sporadic, even though OAT yields have risen considerably in recent years. In other words, the markets—driven by the numbers—trust France less and less, while the rating agencies—driven primarily by politics—still place enormous confidence in the Hexagon.

Credit where credit is due to French institutions: being able to sell yourself for more than you’re worth is a sign of cunning and power, which we might call “_economic soft power_.”  
Politics, like life, often hinges on appearances. And when it comes to appearances, each person faces a choice: to trust the narratives—sometimes sincere, sometimes less so—or to look at the numbers with effort and study, and persist, unflaggingly, in the pursuit of a small but irrepressible truth.
