Three cents. What are three cents? Nothing. There is nothing you can buy for three cents—
not even a Goleador for Italians, not even a pack of Mistral Gagnant for elderly French
people. Perhaps the biodegradable fruit bag at the supermarket. Those two tiny copper pieces,
so modest they don’t even possess that fascinating jingling sound that has led many men to
the abyss of existence. Looking at the emblem on the back, I am always struck by the contrast
between the value of these two small coins and the austere majesty of the Mole Antonelliana
and Castel del Monte. Is greatness hidden in three cents?
In some cases, one might say yes. At the last Paris Olympics, in the queen of races—the 100
meters—three cents separated first place from fourth. Between Lyles and Simbine. Between
eternal glory and obscure oblivion. In 2000, three cents would have allowed Al Gore to
secure Florida and become President of the United States instead of George W. Bush, perhaps
altering the course of recent history.
Perhaps today we are witnessing another rare case. In the German elections, Sahra
Wagenknecht's party obtained 4.97%, failing to enter the Bundestag by just three cents. The
Christian Democratic political landscape in Germany now faces a crossroads: attempt to
revive the Große Koalition with the Social Democrats or open the “control room” to the
extremists of AfD. These are the only two possibilities for a parliamentary majority. Those
mere three cents have at least granted the freedom to choose. They have given Merz an
alternative to the Alternative (wordplay intended...). Yes, because if Sahra Wagenknecht had
reached the crucial 5% threshold, she would have secured around 35 seats, taking them away
from other parties. In that case, the Große Koalition Union+SPD would not have reached a
majority. They might have included the Greens in an unlikely coalition, too varied to govern
effectively and to be seen as credible. The only viable majority would have been Union+AfD,
opening up scenarios unthinkable until very recently.

Some external observers might wonder what the issue is with allowing a party with various
positions close to neo-Nazism into the halls of power. After all, almost all so-called
“populist” parties, once in power, have either normalized or quieted down. After all, even
Fratelli d'Italia has its origins in neo-fascism. Yet, everyone, even those who invoke its
specter daily, knows that fascism will not return to Italy. Fascism took root under extremely
unique historical circumstances, impossible to replicate today. But what strikes me most is
the paradox of a dictatorship based on discipline, order, and obedience to the State, born in
the very country where discipline, order, and obedience to the State are regarded with deep
contempt.
But Germany is not Italy. Germans value order and rules (I swear, it’s not a stereotype...), and
that is precisely why the German version of fascism proved dramatically more efficient in its
horror. Many Germans know this. And they are afraid.
Sometimes, the dwarves dig too deep and awaken the Balrog. Sometimes, the demon of the
past can reawaken, and surrendering to it can be an easy temptation. But Gandalf is wise and
confronts the Balrog. And wisdom lies in facing the demon that sleeps within each of us,
always ready to strike again.
